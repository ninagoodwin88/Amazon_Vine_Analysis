# Furniture Products - Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The analysis will determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the furniture department.


### DELIVERABLE RESULTS:

**Helpful Reviews (All) with 5 Star:**  
For all reviews and "helpful" reviews, **around half of the ratings are 5 Star**, which indicates that the Vine programs tend to give 5 Stars over any other rating.

**Percentage of Vine Reviews are 5-star:**  
For all the Vine Reviews, we found almost the same, a little more lower ratings than 5 Star.

By Filtering the "helpful" reviews only, we saw and found a light difference; **a lower 1%** of the 5 Star review from Vine.
